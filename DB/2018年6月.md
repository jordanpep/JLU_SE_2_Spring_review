1.$\Pi_{Gname}\sigma_{Pname='wxy'}(GAME \infty PG \infty PERSON)$

```mysql
SELECT Gname
FROM GAME
WHERE Pid IN (
SELECT Gid
FROM PG
WHERE pid = (
SELECT Pid
FROM PERSON
WHERE Pname='wxy'))
```

2.$\Pi_{Gname} \sigma _ {countg>500}(_{countg}g_{count(gid)}(PG\infin GAME))$

```mysql
SELECT Gname
FROM Game
WHERE Gid IN (
SELECT Gid
FROM PG
GROUP BY gid
HAVING COUNT(Gid)>500)
```

3.$\Pi _{Pname}(\sigma_{Gname='G01'}(GAME\infin PG \infin PERSON)-\sigma_{Gname='G02'}(GAME\infin PG \infin PERSON))$

```mysql
SELECT Pname
FROM PERSON
WHERE Pid in (
SELECT Pid
FROM PG
WHERE Gid =(
SELECT Gid
FROM GAME
WHERE Gname='G01'))-(
SELECT Pid
FROM PG
WHERE Gid = (
SELECT Gid
FROM GAME
WHERE Gname='G01'))))
```

4.

```mysql
SELECT Pname
FROM PERSON
WHERE Pid IN (
SELECT Pid

WHERE Gid IN (
SELECT Gid
FROM GAME
WHERE TYPE='益智类'))
```

5.

```mysql
SELECT Gname
FROM GAME
WHERE Gid IN (
SELECT DISTINCT Gid
FROM PG
WHERE Pid IN (
SELECT Pid
FROM PERSON
WHERE age >=15 AND age<=25))
```

6.

```mysql
INSERT INTO PG(Pid,Gid) VALUES('P01','G02');
```
